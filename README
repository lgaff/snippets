Bits and pieces that I've had lying about:

- barebones-kernel: A barebones 'kernel'. Does nothing except boot the machine and print a string. uses the grub stage1/2 loaders to get it there after the handrolled bootblock.
- fractals: I have a fetish for writing mandelbrot plotters and other fractal visualisation algorithms in various languages. These are the ones I had lying around
- snake: An ncurses based clone of snake.
- tetris: An incomplete ncurses clone of Tetris
- random-perl: Mostly bad perl, including some codegolf entries.
